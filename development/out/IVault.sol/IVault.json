The system operates on a dual-token model: (1) Users deposit kTokens (1:1 backed\n tokens) and receive stkTokens (share tokens) that accrue yield, (2) Batch processing aggregates multiple user\n operations for gas efficiency and fair pricing, (3) Two-phase operations (request → claim) enable optimal\n settlement coordination with the broader protocol. Key features include: asset flow coordination with kAssetRouter\n for virtual balance management, integration with DN vaults for yield source diversification, batch settlement\n system for gas-efficient operations, and automated yield distribution through share price appreciation rather\n than token rebasing.
